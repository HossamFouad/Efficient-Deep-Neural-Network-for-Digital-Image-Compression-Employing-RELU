# Efficient-Deep-Neural-Network-for-Digital-Image-Compression-Employing-RELU
Using Neural Networks for lossy image Compression 
This is an implementation to this Paper"Efficient Deep Neural Network for Digital Image Compression Employing Rectified Linear Neurons"
https://www.hindawi.com/journals/js/2016/3184840/
It does unsupervised learning using Deep Neural Nets Employing RELU

The Implementation has been done using Matlab Environment for Deep Architecture Learning
https://github.com/dustinstansbury/medal

RELU function and its dervivative are added to mlnn.m , you should replace it with one in Matlab Environment for Deep Architecture Learning
put all files inside the Matlab Environment for Deep Architecture Learning folder
